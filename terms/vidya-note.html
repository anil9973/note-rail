                <p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by
                    any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be
                    contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within
                    such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from
                    other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with

                    etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services.
                    You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

                    Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not
                    operate
